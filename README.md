#  Project Overview
This project is designed to handle task management with clear role-based access control. It features two user roles: Admin and Employee. Employees can only view their assigned tasks, while the Admin has a broader view to monitor and report on all tasks. The data refreshes automatically, making it suitable for real-time monitoring needs
